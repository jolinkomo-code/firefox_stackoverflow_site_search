# Firefox Extension To Search Through Stackoverflow Only
### Uses duckduckgo to search your query in StackOverflow only

A Firefox extension for searching Stackoverflow from the address bar.

Just type 'so' in the address bar followed by your search string and press ENTER.

Example: "so how to set native props in react native" and press ENTER to get duckduckgo to search stackoverflow only
I'm using a search engine to search through stackoverflow instead of of searching in stackoverflow directly because stackoverflow will sometimes 
ask for a recaptcha, which can be annoying. 

# Why DuckDuckGo?
Its the same reason why I'm not searching in stackoverflow directly, using google will also ask for recapchas 
if you using a VPN.
