# Firefox Extension To Search Through Stackoverflow Only
### Uses duckduckgo to search your query in StackOverflow only

The plugin is activated when you type 'ss' in the address bar, followed by your query, then when you press enter, it searches through the stackoverflow domain.

I'm using a search engine to search through stackoverflow instead of searching in stackoverflow directly because stackoverflow will sometimes 
ask for a recaptcha, which can be annoying. 

# Why use DuckDuckGo?
Its the same reason why I'm not searching in stackoverflow directly, using google will also ask for recapchas 
if you using a VPN.
